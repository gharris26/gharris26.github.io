        <strong>1. What are Class and ID Selectors?</strong>
        <br />
        <br />
        Class and ID are HTML/CSS Selectors that are used to enhance web design
        by adding a variety of styles through HTML and CSS interplay. Their
        functions are similar, but they are not the same and they serve
        different purposes.
        <br />
        <br />
        <img
          src="./images/example1.png"
          width="300"
          height="100"
          alt="Example of h1 styling"
        />
        <br />
        This is how you would style ALL the h1 elements in CSS.
        <br />
        <br />
        But what if you want your initial h1 header to be different? Perhaps,
        you want the basic styling to remain the same, but you want to change
        the colour or font. This is where assigning a Class or ID comes in
        useful.
        <br />
        <br />
        <img
          src="./images/example2.png"
          width="300"
          height="50"
          alt="Example of h1 with an assigned class/id"
        />
        <br />
        This is what an h1 header looks like when it has been assigned a Class
        and ID.

        <strong>2.Differences in Class and ID.</strong>
        <br />
        <br />
        The most notable difference between the two Selectors is that you can
        use the same Class for multiple elements, and you can use multiple
        classes within the same element. On the other hand, ID can only have one
        element by that name and each element can only have one ID.
        <br />
        <br />
        Essentially, ID is more specific to that element. It is easier to
        remember this difference when you think of a university cohort: students
        are assigned to a shared class, but each student has an ID that is
        unique to just them. Students may have multiple classes that they attend
        but their ID stays consistent and individual.
        <br />
        <br />
        Another difference to note is that, in CSS, Classes use a “.” in front
        of their name, while IDs use a “#”.
        <br />
        <br />
        <img
          src="./images/example3.1.png"
          width="300"
          height="50"
          alt="Example of Class in HTML"
        />
        <img
          src="./images/example3.2.png"
          width="150"
          height="50"
          alt="Example of Class in CSS"
        />
        <br />
        <img
          src="./images/example4.1.png"
          width="300"
          height="50"
          alt="Example of ID in HTML"
        />
        <img
          src="./images/example4.2.png"
          width="150"
          height="50"
          alt="Example of ID in CSS"
        />
        <br />
        Here is an example of how to use Class and ID in an HTML file and the
        corresponding CSS file.

        <strong>3. But which should you use? Class or ID?</strong>
        <br />
        <br />
        While they serve similar functions, it is important to correctly
        identify which Selector to use as it keeps your code clean and makes it
        easier to work with.
        <br />
        <br />
        You should use a Class when you need to use that same Selector more than
        once. While an ID Selector can only be used by a single element, Classes
        can be assigned to multiple elements and are less specific or unique. As
        an ID Selector is more specific, they also take priority over Class.
        <br />
        <br />
        <img
          src="./images/example5.1.png"
          width="300"
          height="50"
          alt="Example of white Class and Black ID in HTML"
        />
        <br>
        <img
          src="./images/example5.2.png"
          width="300"
          height="300"
          alt="Example of white Class and Black ID in CSS"
        />
        <br>
        <img
          src="./images/example5.3.png"
          width="300"
          height="30"
          alt="Example of the black ID taking priority"
        />
        <br />
        As you can see in the image above, the header text is red rather than
        blue due to the ID being more specific and having priority in the code.
        <br />
        <br />
        Since these Selectors serve different functions, an element can also
        have both a Class and an ID.
        <br />
        <br />
        <img
          src="./images/example6.png"
          width="300"
          height="50"
          alt="Example of a general Class then specific ID"
        />
        <br />
        In this case, the element has the Class of being a .titleHeader and the
        ID of being #firstheader.
        <br />
        <br />An element can have an ID and then multiple Classes or Selectors,
        but it is considered best practice to make sure you understand when to
        use these Selectors before you begin stacking them, as it can make your
        code confusing or hard to navigate.

        <strong>4. Keeping your code clean and easy to navigate.</strong>
        <br />
        <br />
        As code develops and becomes more complex, it would be in your best
        interest to keep your code as neat as possible. When an element has
        multiple factors such as h1, Class, and ID, it can become difficult to
        navigate.
        <br />
        <br />
        <img
          src="./images/example7.1.png"
          width="300"
          height="370"
          alt="Example of an h1 header that has styling applied to h1, class, and id"
        />
        <br />
        Above is an example of an element that has multiple styles applied to
        it.
        <br />
        <br />
        <img
          src="./images/example7.2.png"
          width="300"
          height="200"
          alt="Example of the same header but only using class to style"
        />
        <br />
        Above is an example of a style sheet that primarily uses Class for
        different elements. The Class names are specific and easy to navigate to
        in case you need to change their styling.
        <br />
        <br />
        While there is no harm in using h1, h2, or p as your points of style in
        CSS, the more complex your code becomes the more you need to think about
        HOW your code is organised. Not just for your own sake – but for those
        who may need to read through your code.
