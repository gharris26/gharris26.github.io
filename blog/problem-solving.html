        I’m not sure whether this classifies itself as a ‘simple problem’ but
        recently, while working on the Javascript Kata, I was extremely stuck on
        the ‘deBee’ portion of the built-in methods. I was convinced that my
        code was correct. I spent a lot of time researching how it was supposed
        to look - and getting very confused by more complex coding questions.
        <br />
        <br />
        Pseudocode is normally my favourite problem-solving technique when I am
        stuck, however, it didn’t seem to be helping.
        <br />
        // Use .split() > > // Use .filter() > > // Use .join() >> // Return
        <br />
        The steps were so clear and simple to me, that it was hard to figure out
        where I had gone wrong. I even tried explaining my thought-process out
        loud. Did some more research. Stared at my screen. Took a walk.
        Eventually, I put it to bed and tried again the next day.
        <br />
        <br />
        It wasn’t until I looked at my code the next day that I realised exactly
        where I had gone wrong. And boy, was it even more frustrating. I had
        managed to get everything correct – even the confusing .filter()
        section! – but had made one tiny mistake. I forgot to put a space
        between my .split() and .join() ‘’s.
        <br />
        <br />
        From this experience I learned, you should probably read the test
        outcome – because they normally TELL you what’s wrong. And, if a
        question is so confusing and frustrating that you can’t even fathom the
        mistake… maybe sleep on it. That isn’t always an option but coming back
        to it the next day with a fresh mind has always helped me, immensely.

        The manipulating objects section of the Javascript Kata was definitely
        my favourite exercise, by far. The steps were neatly laid out, so for
        once I didn’t feel the need to pseudocode (I usually only do that to
        break up big problems). Instead, I was really forced to take each step
        one at a time. For me, one of my biggest issues is slowing down and not
        rushing or being impatient to get to the result.
        <br />
        <br />
        I also, genuinely, tried to solve the steps by myself without
        researching everything beforehand. I would write what I thought was the
        answer then saved it and checked my answer against the test. Once I got
        the pattern down, the rest seemed to go by easily and I completed the
        first few questions without needing to research the answers online at
        all. (Though, I did have to look up the syntax of the delete operator
        and the ben property, as they were slightly out of my comfort zone.)
        <br />
        <br />
        I also talked to myself more during this section. Which might sound odd.
        But muttering to myself seemed to help. Regardless, this problem felt
        much more calm and much less chaotic and rushed than usual. I think I
        have learned that I seriously just need to slow down. Stop being so
        impatient. Read the questions. And, most of all, have the confidence to
        try things on my own.

        Pseudocode.
        <br />
        This is my favourite problem-solving technique for breaking down big
        questions that seem impossible to me. I don’t use it with every single
        problem that I encounter but if the Javascript Kata’s have taught me
        anything it’s that I do well when the problem is cut up into steps. It
        seems much less impossible and much more manageable.
        <br />
        <br />
        Trying something.
        <br />
        This is where I struggle the most. I think I have this fear of failing
        or not being able to do something perfectly the first time, so trying
        something by myself is a bit scary. Especially, if I haven’t googled how
        to do something beforehand.
        <br />
        <br />
        Rubber ducky method.
        <br />
        It’s less talking to a rubber ducky than just muttering to myself.
        Sometimes with a bit of pacing included like I’m an evil genius in a
        sit-com. It definitely helps talking out loud; especially when I get to
        the parts that I haven’t exactly ironed out yet. I find that I tend to
        trail off and then I sit there in silence as if to say, “Okay, so what
        actually is the next step?”
        <br />
        <br />
        Reading error messages.
        <br />
        Note to my future self: READ THE ERROR MESSAGES. Yes, they’re a little
        confusing to look at the first few times around. But, oh my GOSH. They
        help so much! When I was working on reversing a string; I kept wondering
        why my code wasn’t working. Turns out, by checking my error message, all
        I had to do was remove the space between the ‘’ (my nemesis returns!)
        and suddenly the letters became a single string rather than an array of
        letters!
        <br />
        <br />
        Console.logging.
        <br />
        I’m not as confident with using console.logging. I can absolutely
        understand why it is important, but I tend to just run the test rather
        than bothering to check the console.log. I know that this
        problem-solving tool will be more important later on though, so I will
        work on this.
        <br />
        <br />
        Googling.
        <br />
        Actually, I take it back that pseudocode is my favourite problem-solving
        tool. I love to google every. single. thing; even things that I already
        know for some reason? If I get stuck or can’t remember something? MDN
        and W3, here I come. I think this might be a developing bad habit. I am
        very nervous about making mistakes or not knowing things so, in a way,
        googling everything is a bit of a crutch for me. But I am working on
        that! I’m hoping that the more I learn and the more I do things, the
        more confident I will feel in tackling problems off the dome.
        <br />
        <br />
        Asking your peers for help.
        <br />
        I will admit that I have not done this at all, so far. I’m sure it’ll be
        a problem-solving tool I will utilise more when we start bootcamp and
        actually work in teams, but as of right now… I would rather figure it
        out myself or ask a facilitator. Hopefully I get the chance to work on
        this in the future! It would be nice to be able to ask my peers and for
        them to ask me questions too.
        <br />
        <br />
        Asking your coaches for help.
        <br />
        As mentioned above, I don’t really ask my peers for help but I am
        getting much better at asking our coaches. Recently, I even asked for
        clarification on the wording of a problem (which, turns out, I was doing
        wrong from the start so that was my own bad and lack of understanding).
        This still tends to be my last resort, though.
        <br />
        <br />
        Improving your process with reflection. Reflection is fun! I feel like
        my reflection process isn’t bad at the moment, though I’m sure it could
        be improved. More specifically, I need to improve my review process!
        Going over the questions that really stumped me and researching the
        things that seem to always trip me up.

      Reflect on a time you were reluctant to ask for help. Consider what made
      you reluctant to do so. What might you try differently next time?

        Recently, I asked for clarification on the wording of a problem in the
        Javascript Kata. I was very confused about how to approach the question.
        Even after I asked for clarification, I don’t think I really understood
        what was being asked of me. In reality, I should have pressed the issue
        – said I was still confused – but I felt a bit embarrassed. I mean, I’d
        already asked once, right?
        <br />
        <br />
        In the end, I re-read the question and checked it over on the student
        handbook (which basically said the same instructions but slightly
        clearer). I realised it made more sense to use a for loop with a
        function, not a function with a for loop. But, I would have saved myself
        so much time and agony if I’d just pressed the issue.
