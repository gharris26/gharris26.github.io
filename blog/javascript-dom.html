    <div class="answerContainer">
      <p class="answerText">
        So, you want to build a website but are confused about how Javascript
        interacts with HTML and CSS? Let's start with a simple analogy!
        <br />
        <br />
        Instead of a website, let's imagine that we are organising the
        construction of an actual building. We are the construction manager for
        this project; we look over all of the different components and ensure
        that they are interacting smoothly. We also tell everyone what to do
        (fun!).
        <br />
        <br />
        In this case, HTML would be the actual building of the project. HTML
        lays down the foundations and the simple lines for how the building is
        going to be laid out; the walls, the roof, the floors, hallways, and
        rooms. Without HTML, there would be no building at all.
        <br />
        <br />
        CSS is the interior design aspect of the build. It takes the bare bones
        of the foundations and makes it more attractive. CSS adds paint, color,
        decoration, and just generally makes the building more interesting to
        look at.
        <br />
        <br />
        Javascript is the hard part that is usually handled by the specialists
        on site. The electricity, plumbing, security features, or general
        automation tasks are handled by Javascript. This makes the build more
        interactive and functional in design, basically taking it from a pretty
        base building and making it responsive to living.
