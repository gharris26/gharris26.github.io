    <h3 class="subtitleHeader">1. What is Emotional Intelligence?</h3>

    <div class="answerContainer">
      <p class="answerText">
        Emotional Intelligence refers to a person's ability to identify,
        evaluate, control, perceive, and express emotions. As well as the
        ability to relate to others, having a high EQ boosts empathy,
        self-awareness, the quality of your inter-personal relationships and the
        ability to maintain those relationships through a mutual understanding.

    <h3 class="subtitleHeader">2. How is EQ different to IQ?</h3>

    <div class="answerContainer">
      <p class="answerText">
        If I were to use a metaphor, I would compare EQ and IQ to delivering a
        speech. IQ is the substance of the speech; it is the carefully chosen
        topic, the curated research, and the visual representation of Slides or
        PowerPoints. However, EQ is the deliverance of the speech; it is the
        charismatic speaking voice, the neatly-kept personal appearance, and,
        most importantly, the witty and inspiring writing.

        <br />
        IQ measures your intelligence, knowledge, analytic thinking, reasoning,
        and logic. EQ measures your ability to empathise with others, your
        control over your emotions, and your ability to understand others.
        Essentially, as cheesy as it may sound, if IQ is represented by the
        brain, then EQ must be represented by the heart.

    <h3 class="subtitleHeader">3. Why is EQ important?</h3>

    <div class="answerContainer">
      <p class="answerText">
        There was a great example of EQ being the equivalent to 'street-smarts'.
        Emotional intelligence is a necessary skill, particularly in a human
        society where being social is a huge obstacle for some. It is important
        to be able to look at a person and identify whether they are feeling sad
        or upset, to empathise with them, and to build or maintain solid
        relationships. While I'm sure it does exist, it is hard to find a job
        that doesn't deal with any other people at all - working in a team with
        low EQ is like working in a library when you can hardly read. While it
        isn't impossible, it certainly makes things difficult for you.
