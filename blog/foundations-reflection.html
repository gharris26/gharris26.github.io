        <br />
        That there are still areas that I can improve upon. I have always
        considered myself an empathetic person but the idea of learning to
        better control your emotions and reactions to things - and learning
        about how you learn - has been really good for me.

          and programming?</strong
        >
        <br />
        First and foremost, teamwork and communication play vital roles in
        programming. You could be the best coder in the world but if you can't
        tell others how that code works, how to fix it, or explain any of the
        problems you come across, then you won't be much help as a coworker or
        teammate. The same goes for self-awareness, you need to be aware of how
        you are approaching learning and what you think of yourself - because if
        you tell yourself you can't do something, then you probably won't be
        able to.

        <br />
        That it has actually been useful. That sounds very prideful and maybe a
        little over-confident but, as mentioned before, I do think of myself as
        an empathetic, emotionally intelligent person. Especially when it comes
        to soft or human skills. But there is always room to improve and this
        course has shown me that. Reading about neuroplasticity and the growth
        mindset were the more eye-opening examples; it pointed out some
        weaknesses in myself that I have been aware of for a while, proved how
        dangerous those habits could be, and how to move forward from them.

        <br />
        Listening and looping was a little scary at first. Reaching out and
        hoping that somebody would pick you up, talk to you, and listen to you?
        I am lucky that the person I ended up practicing with was really nice
        and that she was willing to continue contact with the second listening
        and looping task. (And the pair programming.) But yeah, putting myself
        out there and being a little vulnerable was scary. Nobody wants to be
        picked last in PE.

          >Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time
          focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp
          course?</strong
        >
        <br />
        When you think of a developer or an individual who codes (or ask someone
        to describe that person), usually the person described is not somebody
        with great core skills. The stereotype might have some truth to it but I
        think coding requires better communication than most humanities-type
        jobs that I have been involved in. Teamwork, communication, the ability
        to deal with making mistakes or being really frustrated with yourself
        and the problems you encounter - all of these are a part of programming
        and learning core skills helps make that job a little easier.
        <br />

          >Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste
          of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming
          instead?</strong
        >
        <br />
        I don't think so. As mentioned above, core learning is instrumental for
        the parts of the job that aren't coding. There is a lot more to
        programming and being a programmer than just coding alone. Nurses and
        doctors learn medicine, but bedside manner is included in that. It is kind of
        like that.
