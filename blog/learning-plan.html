        <strong>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</strong>
        <br />
        Through this course I am hoping to develop my ability to create neat,
        accessible, and useful code. Technology is a massively growing field
        and, moving forward, I would like to have a meaningful impact in the
        community. Whether that is by assisting on an amazing game, mentoring
        other programmers, or changing user interfaces to be more accessible...
        I'm not entirely sure yet. Destination-wise, I do not have a clear image
        in mind of where I want to be. I only know that I am excited to see more
        of the tech sector and where that place may end up being.

          >What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in
          Bootcamp?</strong
        >
        <br />
        Looking back on my original learning plan, I do still believe that my
        strengths and limitations are the same. That said, I am really try to
        work on them. I want to improve my communication to a point where I can
        clearly describe my problems and to communicate my expectations to my
        teammates. I also have been making a big effort to slow down and to stop
        rushing through things as I know that mistakes make me really frustrated
        and will trip me up in bootcamp.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will
        be?</strong>
        <br />
        I think my biggest non-technical challenge will be the chance of
        burn-out. I tend to throw myself completely into tasks and I am worried
        that, if I don't perfect my work-life-study balance then I am at risk of
        burning myself out. That said, in comparison to my last learning plan, I
        am reducing my hours at work. So, therefore, should be able to manage my
        time even better.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see
        developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</strong>
        <br />
        Communication of technical ideas and problems is a skill I would like to
        see developed. While I believe that I am a good communicator, talking
        about code is a little different and is something that will come with
        practice. Other than that, I would really like to develop my leadership
        skills. Both for my own sake and for the sake of others. I think it is
        good to have somebody that we can rely on and if I can be that for
        others then that would be amazing.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</strong>
        <br />
        Support to me looks like regular check-ins with the facilitators to help
        me stay on track and to reassure me that I am progressing at a decent or
        'correct' speed. My biggest issue is feeling like I am not where I need
        to be or that I am not good enough. Reassurance on this helps immensely.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>What are your expectations of yourself in Bootcamp?</strong>
        <br />
        <br />
        I will no longer be working full time! I took the advice of the
        facilitators and have reduced my hours for this portion of the course.
        My time management is usually pretty good - not to toot my own horn -
        but I believe this will really help me in the long run. I will be able
        to make more time for my studies, meetings with facilitators and other
        students. I am committed to getting things done in a timely fashion and
        I really want to do things right. If I need help, I will consult the
        Discord channels as they've proved to be very useful.

        <strong
          >Question One: What is your long term goal or career pathway?</strong
        >
        <br />
        I decided to try and break my long-term career goals down into steps. I
        am hoping to graduate from the DevAcademy with a few decent projects
        under my belt for my portfolio. Then, I would like to obtain a graduate
        position as a software developer at a reputable company, eventually
        becoming a junior, intermediate, and finally a senior. I would like to
        stay full-stack with either a focus on design and front-end development
        or a more client-facing role. Ultimately, I hope to find a completely
        remote role, though I understand that those are hard to come by.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong
          >Question Two: A description of your strengths and limitations when it
          comes to learning.</strong
        >
        <br />
        My strengths would most likely revolve around my interactions with
        others. I enjoy communicating with people, working within a team, and I
        would like to think that I am a strong communicator. I'm also a curious
        person, I enjoy researching topics that interest me and when I don't
        understand a concept, I will often follow it up until it makes sense in
        my own words or understanding.
        <br />
        <br />
        My biggest limitation would be that I can rush through things in my
        enthusiasm, sometimes I miss steps or misread instructions. I am working
        on this, however, and have slowed down a little. I haven't made any huge
        mistakes yet, and I have always fixed my slip-ups by myself which has
        definitely helped my understanding of certain processes.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong
          >Question Three: What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would
          you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</strong
        >
        <br />
        While I would say that I am a strong communicator, I do struggle with
        asking for help sometimes or speaking up on ideas that I have. The first
        comes from a desire not to burden or bother others; something I am
        already forcing myself to overcome by asking questions, even if they are
        silly questions or just asking for more clarification. The second issue
        of sharing my ideas comes from a place of insecurity. Simply put, I
        would like to become more confident in my skills and my ability to lead.
        I would really like to see my leadership skills developed while at the
        DevAcademy.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong
          >Question Four: A commitment to how you will manage your workload in
          this programme.</strong
        >
        <br />
        Currently, I am able to dedicate around 2 hours of course work while I
        am at my full-time job. This is typically more research based learning
        or study that doesn't require actual coding or terminal time. This is
        because I prefer to sit down at home, after dinner usually, and code
        then. I find myself much more focused in the evenings and I am able to
        'focus up' so to speak, for multiple hours without distractions. I also
        have the support of my partner who is a software developer, in case I
        have questions. This usually results in an average of 4 hours a day. So
        far, I have found it easy to keep up with the pace of Foundations,
        though I know things are likely to change once Bootcamp hits and I am
        prepared to dedicate more time and more hours as we progress. Should
        things get too much, I am an easy person to destress - usually this
        involves downtime, food, a good movie or a solid sleep. I find I am
        always in a better mood or headspace after those particular things.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong
          >Question Five: A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in
          a timely way.</strong
        >
        <br />
        When I encounter a problem, my first step is to try and figure it out on
        my own. While I know that the facilitators recommend only trying to
        problem-solve for 10 minutes, I have found that 15 minutes is my max
        time regardless. At that point I tend to get quite frustrated and will
        either turn to my partner for assistance/support or the Discord
        channels. The facilitators are usually quite prompt with responses and I
        can sometimes search the Discord chatrooms for any similar problems from
        other students.
        <br />
        <br />
        As mentioned above, one of my limitations is that I can rush through
        things when excited. I like to move quickly and don't enjoy being stuck
        on a problem. My commitment to seeking help is pretty simple; I don't
        like to sit stagnant for too long.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong
          >Question Six: A description of what you expect from the Facilitation
          team.</strong
        >
        <br />
        The facilitators have been incredibly helpful and approachable so far.
        John and Shrena make me feel safe asking questions or speaking up during
        our group meetings. I think I just expect the facilitation team to stay
        patient and to be supportive during this learning journey.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong
          >Question Seven: Any scheduling information such as block-out times
          when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have
          whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these
          in.</strong
        >
        <br />
        This is a tricky one for me as I work full-time. Currently, I am working
        from 8-4, Monday to Friday. While I am able to study at work,
        particularly during the quieter parts of the day, I think the biggest
        hurdle for me will be attending meetings or calls. My work doesn't mind
        me studying at my computer but taking calls is a different matter. Once
        we hit the Bootcamp portion, I will most likely have to take annual
        leave for the two-hour weekly meetings. Other than that, I have no other
        major commitments.
