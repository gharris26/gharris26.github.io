      Question One: What is your long term goal or career pathway?
    </h3>

    <div class="answerContainer">
      <p class="answerText">
        I decided to try and break my long-term career goals down into steps. I
        am hoping to graduate from the DevAcademy with a few decent projects
        under my belt for my portfolio. Then, I would like to obtain a graduate
        position as a software developer at a reputable company, eventually
        becoming a junior, intermediate, and finally a senior. I would like to
        stay full-stack with either a focus on design and front-end development
        or a more client-facing role. Ultimately, I hope to find a completely
        remote role, though I understand that those are hard to come by.

      Question Two: A description of your strengths and limitations when it
      comes to learning.
    </h3>

    <div class="answerContainer">
      <p class="answerText">
        My strengths would most likely revolve around my interactions with
        others. I enjoy communicating with people, working within a team, and I
        would like to think that I am a strong communicator. I'm also a curious
        person, I enjoy researching topics that interest me and when I don't
        understand a concept, I will often follow it up until it makes sense in
        my own words or understanding.
        <br />
        <br />
        My biggest limitation would be that I can rush through things in my
        enthusiasm, sometimes I miss steps or misread instructions. I am working
        on this, however, and have slowed down a little. I haven't made any huge
        mistakes yet, and I have always fixed my slip-ups by myself which has
        definitely helped my understanding of certain processes.

    <h3 class="subtitleHeader">
      Question Three: What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you
      like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
    </h3>

    <div class="answerContainer">
      <p class="answerText">
        While I would say that I am a strong communicator, I do struggle with
        asking for help sometimes or speaking up on ideas that I have. The first
        comes from a desire not to burden or bother others; something I am
        already forcing myself to overcome by asking questions, even if they are
        silly questions or just asking for more clarification. The second issue
        of sharing my ideas comes from a place of insecurity. Simply put, I
        would like to become more confident in my skills and my ability to lead.
        I would really like to see my leadership skills developed while at the
        DevAcademy.

      Question Four: A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.
    </h3>

    <div class="answerContainer">
      <p class="answerText">
        Currently, I am able to dedicate around 2 hours of course work while I am at my full-time job. This is typically more research based learning or study that doesn't require actual coding or terminal time. This is because I prefer to sit down at home, after dinner usually, and code then. I find myself much more focused in the evenings and I am able to 'focus up' so to speak, for multiple hours without distractions. I also have the support of my partner who is a software developer, in case I have questions. This usually results in an average of 4 hours a day. So far, I have found it easy to keep up with the pace of Foundations, though I know things are likely to change once Bootcamp hits and I am prepared to dedicate more time and more hours as we progress. Should things get too much, I am an easy person to destress - usually this involves downtime, food, a good movie or a solid sleep. I find I am always in a better mood or headspace after those particular things.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h3 class="subtitleHeader">
      Question Five: A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way.
    </h3>

    <div class="answerContainer">
      <p class="answerText">
        When I encounter a problem, my first step is to try and figure it out on my own. While I know that the facilitators recommend only trying to problem-solve for 10 minutes, I have found that 15 minutes is my max time regardless. At that point I tend to get quite frustrated and will either turn to my partner for assistance/support or the Discord channels. The facilitators are usually quite prompt with responses and I can sometimes search the Discord chatrooms for any similar problems from other students.
        <br>
        <br>
        As mentioned above, one of my limitations is that I can rush through things when excited. I like to move quickly and don't enjoy being stuck on a problem. My commitment to seeking help is pretty simple; I don't like to sit stagnant for too long.
      </p>

    <h3 class="subtitleHeader">
      Question Six: A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team.
    </h3>

    <div class="answerContainer">
      <p class="answerText">
        The facilitators have been incredibly helpful and approachable so far. John and Shrena make me feel safe asking questions or speaking up during our group meetings. I think I just expect the facilitation team to stay patient and to be supportive during this learning journey.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h3 class="subtitleHeader">
      Question Seven: Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whƒÅnau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.
    </h3>

    <div class="answerContainer">
      <p class="answerText">
        This is a tricky one for me as I work full-time. Currently, I am working from 8-4, Monday to Friday. While I am able to study at work, particularly during the quieter parts of the day, I think the biggest hurdle for me will be attending meetings or calls. My work doesn't mind me studying at my computer but taking calls is a different matter. Once we hit the Bootcamp portion, I will most likely have to take annual leave for the two-hour weekly meetings. Other than that, I have no other major commitments.
