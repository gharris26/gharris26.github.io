      Researching Neuroplasticity and Growth Mindset
    </h1>

  <h3 class="subtitleHeader">1. Research Neuroplasticity</h3>

  <div class="answerContainer">
    <p class="answerText">
      Neuroplasticity is the ability of the brain to “rewrite” itself or the
      ability to change and adapt over time by creating new neural
      connections. Our brains are complex organs, responsible for our mental
      functioning, and scientists have discovered that these complex organs
      can adapt to changes by physically altering their make-up. This
      “plastic” quality of the brain can even be used to compensate for
      injuries and illnesses by reassigning tasks to different parts of the
      brain! Cool!
      <br>
      <br>
      Studies have shown that by simply understanding this fact –
      that intelligence and our brains are malleable to our own purpose – can
      improve performance and morale. The idea that our default intelligence
      is unchangeable is a grim one, so of course you’d feel more motivated
      knowing that’s simply not the case!
      <br>
      <br>
      Performing a task repetitively and
      recalling information affects different neurons in the brain,
      strengthening neural connections. Basically, practice makes perfect and
      the more you do a task, over and over and over again, the stronger and
      more efficient your neural networks will become!
      <br>
      <br>
    <ul>Besides practicing, you
      can increase your neuroplasticity through numerous other methods. Such
      as:
      <li><strong>Learning something new.</strong> Learning a new skill, language, instrument,
        or even a new sport helps to stimulate the new pathways in our brains!</li>
      <li><strong>Context.</strong> Putting that learning into context and recognising that
        learning is the formation of neural connections – how does this new
        skill relate to information that you have already learned? Knowing those
        connections of concepts helps with long-term memory retention.</li>
      <li><strong>Mindfulness.</strong> As we learned about in a previous Sprint, mediation and
        mindfulness are also found to promote neuroplasticity. Reducing stress
        and learning to control emotions helps immensely as cortisol – or stress
        – can reduce neuroplasticity. </li>
      <li><strong>Exercise, diet, and sleep. </strong>While all these
        things are shown to improve your physical health, they are also great
        for improving neuroplasticity! Most of all, sleep is essential for a
        healthy brain. While you are sleeping, your brain consolidates what it
        has learned over the course of the day, i.e., “memories”.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <br>
    Talking about the idea of “memory” it is important to clarify what exactly we are referring to as there are,
    generally, two classes of memories when it
    comes to learned skills in psychology. The first class is known as
    “explicit” memories which consist of “episodic memories” for events and
    “semantic memories” for concepts and facts. The second class is known as
    “implicit” memories which would be the memory for actions. A subclass of
    “implicit memories” is called “procedural” memory which relates
    specifically to learned skills and developing habits. Examples of this
    being, brushing your teeth, tying your shoelaces, or riding a bike.
    While all memory models are important for neuroplasticity, implicit and
    procedural are the main target for synaptic plasticity. That idea of
    “practice makes perfect” falls under this procedural memory category as
    it strengthens those connections through repeated and persistent
    cellular activation.

  <h3 class="subtitleHeader">2. Research Growth Mindset</h3>

  <div class="answerContainer">
    <p class="answerText">
      A growth mindset is the belief that one’s intelligence or talents are malleable and can be developed through
      persistence, effort, and a focus on learning. It might take some failures, some mistakes and some struggling, but
      ultimately the growth mindset maintains that through perseverance and effort, the learner can succeed. But why is
      that relevant? Think about it like this: your mindset is your own personal sense of beliefs, and it is the way of
      thinking that ultimately influences your attitude and behaviour towards yourself and others. If you have a “fixed
      mindset” you are more likely to give up easily, lack resilience, and lack engagement in the learning environment.
      Which is fair, if you lack the belief in yourself that you can do something, why even bother, right?
      <br>
      <br>
      Breaking down that belief that your current intelligence level is as high as you can go, that whatever lies beyond
      that is unattainable, is incredibly important for your progress as a learner.
      <br>
      <br>
      Reading about the growth mindset in a classroom setting (I will link the reference below), really helped me to
      open my eyes about how I approach learning. If I am not immediately good at something, if I don’t understand
      something the first few times, I tend to write myself off as “dumb” or “incapable”. That has been a common factor
      in learning Javascript. Hearing about this growth mindset has made me realise that I need to stop putting myself
      down and stop settling for things that don’t deeply challenge me. For me, positive affirmation and simply
      believing in myself will help me to grow and achieve my goals.

  <h3 class="subtitleHeader">3. Blend with your learning plan and strategies</h3>

  <div class="answerContainer">
    <p class="answerText">
      <ul>After reviewing the effects of neuroplasticity and a growth mindset on intelligence, memory retention, and
      learning skills, I am determined to include these aspects into my own learning plan. Primarily, my focus will be
      on three things:
      <li><strong>Pracitce.</strong>As mentioned in the neuroplasticity section, procedural memories help to strengthen lasting connections
      through repeated cellular activation. Basically, the more you work a muscle, the stronger it will become. And the
      same idea applies to the brain. I enjoy repetitive tasks so I think I will enjoy the practice, even if it does get
      a little tedious.</li> 
      <li><strong>Positive affirmation.</strong> As mentioned in the growth mindset section, I have the tendency to put myself down when
      things get tough. Reminding myself that “yes, things are tough, but I can move past this” will be hard but
      necessary. Maybe I won’t believe it at first but moving from a fixed mindset to one of growth won’t just happen
      overnight.</li> 
      <li><strong>Mindfulness.</strong> I believe mindfulness covers both neuroplasticity and the growth mindset. I also believe that it
      caters specifically to one of my worst habits – impatience. If I’m not immediately good at something or if it
      doesn’t work the first time, then I get annoyed at myself. I believe being mindful, taking a step back, and
      controlling those pesky emotions, will really help my growth as a learner in this course.</li> 
      </ul>
