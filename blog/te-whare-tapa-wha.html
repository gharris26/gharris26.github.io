        Te Whare Tapa Wha is a wellbeing model developed by Sir Mason Durie in
        1984. The model depicts a wharenui or meeting house with four main
        walls. These walls represent taha wairua - our spiritual wellbeing, taha
        hinengaro - mental and emotional wellbeing, taha tinana - our physical
        wellbeing, and taha whanau - our family and social wellbeing. At the
        base is whenua - our connection to the land that forms our foundation.
        Using these four walls and foundations, I will be creating a wellbeing
        plan using the Te Whare Tapa Wha model.

        Taking care of ourselves should be considered a no-brainer, but there
        may be aspects of your everyday life that you are neglecting without
        even realising it. Perhaps, you go to the gym everyday but how do you
        protect your spiritual wellbeing? What steps are you taking to ensure
        that your emotional needs are being met? Using the Te Whare Tapa Wha
        model, I have created a wellbeing plan that will hopefully strengthen
        all aspects of my life.

        Above is a wharenui that I have personalised to my own wellbeing and the areas that I
        believe I can improve upon. In many ways, I had already been doing some
        of these things, just not as consciously as I would have liked. For this
        reason, for each wall and for my foundations, I will offer a small
        explanation. 
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>Taha Wairua (spiritual wellbeing).</strong> I have never considered
        myself to be a strongly spiritual person. The things that I believe in
        are mostly limited to the people around me and nature itself. Therefore,
        I wanted to work on something that may have been neglected – my sense of
        identity and self-awareness. Mindfulness is being aware of your
        feelings and your thoughts. It is something I want to incorporate more
        closely in my life, catching those negative emotions before they spiral
        into anything worse. Meditation is an extension of mindfulness to me: it
        is a time to reflect and to recollect. 
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>Taha Hinengaro (emotional and
          mental wellbeing).</strong>Recently, I have been trying to eat healthier and to
        be more mindful of what exactly I am putting into my body. I think
        eating comfort foods is something I tend to fall back on when I am
        stressed or emotional, so learning to appreciate foods that are good for
        me – and make me feel good – would be a win. And, while I don’t think I
        could give up caffeine, I certainly should be cutting down on my intake.
        Especially with caffeine’s propensity to make me anxious. 
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>Taha Tinana
        (physical wellbeing).</strong> I have always been a relatively active person.
        Going to the gym is strangely comforting and I almost always feel good or
        accomplished, afterwards. However, one thing I want to work on would be
        the regularity of when I go. I genuinely think going x5 a week would
        improve not only my physical wellbeing but also my mental wellbeing.
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>
        Taha Whanau (family and social wellbeing).</strong> I recently moved to Auckland,
        less than a year ago. I left a lot of family and friends behind. Making
        time on the weekends to see my family, to call my parents, to hang out
        with friends, has been crucial to my happiness. My partner is very
        supportive and he bolsters this wellbeing a lot but I maintaining those familial and social connections is really important to me.
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>Whenua (land).</strong> The
        thing that I think I have neglected most, is my connection to nature. Currently, my partner and I
        live in an apartment building, in New Zealand’s largest city. I spend most of my
        day working in the library and then an hour or two in a gym. I don’t take much time in nature, outside of a walk or two along the Takapuna Beach.
        Watering the plants on our balcony and spending time in the sunlight, help
        me to feel both accomplished and connected to nature. While I do walk outside, I want to take small
        moments in my everyday life to enjoy what I immediately have access to. The sky from our balcony is really beautiful at sunrise and sunset.
