    <h3 class="subtitleHeader">Question One: Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.</h3>

    <div class="answerContainer">
        <p class="answerText">It was difficult to think of an ethical situation to write upon for this question. This story may sound fictional or like an episode out of a TV soap drama but it is, regretfully, very real.
        <br>
        <br>
        At one point in my life, I was living with three close friends in a shared flat: my best friend, her partner, and our other friend (lets call her Clove). Things were relatively normal in the beginning, until we noticed some recurring issues with Clove - how she would often embellish the truth, deny that certain things had happened, and sometimes straight-out lie.
        <br>
        <br>
        It wasn't until she lied about having cancer that we really began to take notice, however.
        <br>
        <br>
        My best friend's mother has been in and out of chemo for many years, and at the time of this incident she was going through a particularly hard round. It got to a point where we had to face the ethical question of whether we could be friends with someone who had lied about such a serious illness, let alone live with her.
        <br>
        <br>
        We attempted to gently talk to her about it. We told her that we would forgive her, if she simply came clean. Offered to give her support should she go to therapy for - what we assumed was - pathological lying. Unfortunately, she simply doubled down on the lie and we were forced to make a decision.
        <br>
        <br>
        As a flat, we came to the decision to ask her to move out. We gave her plenty of time to find a new flat, offered to help her move out, and even helped to clean her room. Quite simply, we tried to give her as much grace as she needed while sticking to our own morals.
        <br>
        <br>
        When I look back on this decision, it still feels very surreal. This was a person that I was close friends with, a person I had lived in the same home as, somebody who I watched bad TV with and spent late nights watching movies with. But, to continue to ignore or condone her behaviour was just not acceptable. 
        <br>
        <br>
        I would like to think that I am a person with a strong moral code. While this was a hard situation to look back, let alone write out and reflect upon, I think this experience has made me feel more confident in my decision. Knowing where she is now and how she continues to affect the people around her - I think I made the 'right' decision. If it can be called that.

    <h3 class="subtitleHeader">Question Two: Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your values and identity.</h3>

    <div class="answerContainer">
        <p class="answerText">I am lucky enough to come from a very open-minded, outspoken home. My parents have always encouraged 'talking things out' or tackling my problems head-on, and following paths of interest. As such, I am someone who values communication, honesty, and having genuine passion or interest in the things that I do. I believe that my upbringing has really shaped the person that I am today.
        </p>
    </div>

    <h3 class="subtitleHeader">Question Three: Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning journey.</h3>

    <div class="answerContainer">
        <p class="answerText"> I think my biggest strengths would be my ability to connect with others and my curiosity. Socializing is something that I really enjoy and I find it easy to empathize with others, a strength that is very important in group work (which I imagine is a big part of software development). Curiosity is a strength that comes into play with my actual learning; it is a strength that drives me to pursue my interests and to deepen my understanding. Essentially, I really like researching topics, especially if I find them interesting.       
        </p>
    </div>

    <h3 class="subtitleHeader">Question Four: Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career development. How might these affect your learning journey?</h3>

    <div class="answerContainer">
        <p class="answerText"> 
            My biggest limitation would be my ability to undermine myself or second-guess my abilities. I often find myself coming up with an idea that I like but being too self-conscious to bring it up to others in the group. While this has improved as I've gotten older, it could affect my learning journey when I am working in groups and I think of a project that I would like to work on, but find myself unable to express that idea clearly to my teammates. This stems more from a fear of being overbearing or 'bossy' than a fear of speaking out.
        </p>
    </div>

    <h3 class="subtitleHeader">Question Five: Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.</h3>

    <div class="answerContainer">
        <p class="answerText"> When I was in university, we were required to work in a group discussing different pedagogies and how they can be improved upon for diverse learners. One of the pedagogies required video/media usage; everyone in the group was hesitant to begin the project as nobody wanted to have to record themselves. While it is less of a strategic approach, I offered to take the video requirement. I did not want to video myself either but I was willing to do it in order for everyone else to be more motivated with their own projects and to get the ball rolling. This actually turned out to be very helpful as my other team-members were more inclined to help me with my content and were even more thorough with their own pedagogical studies than I believe they would have been if theyâ€™d been forced to take the video option.
